The BR-350 is a pure scale Jacket Model from Byron Originals. This is a true giant scale model of the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom. The scale detailing is very good and includes an extensive set of details for the cockpit. As a modeler you can purchase a set of electronics, wobble pumps, spares and accessories from Byron Design Bureau as well.

This is a very attractive and detailed giant scale model. It is designed for high speed and performance with mixed power sources. It can be flown with turbine engines, nitro, electric or gas systems. It looks great with lots of scale detail including a laser cut canopy, spoilers and other details. It has an amazing wingspan of 5200mm/169" with a length of 1943mm/77". It will require a 20cc to 60cc engine depending upon the system you plan to use. It also has plenty of power and performance for scale aerobatics.
